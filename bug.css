The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `:has()` pseudo-class, specifically when targeting elements based on a class name within a nested structure.  The expectation is that only the parent `<div>` element with a child element having the class `target` will be styled, but due to the specificity and order of CSS selectors, it might not behave as intended. 
```css
div:has(.target) {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.target {
  color: blue;
}

.wrapper div {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.wrapper div:has(.target) {
 background-color: lightgreen;
}

<div class="wrapper">
  <div>
    <p class="target">This paragraph is targeted.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>This is not targeted.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
