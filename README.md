# CSS :has() Selector Specificity Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with the CSS `:has()` pseudo-class selector when dealing with nested elements and class targeting.  The problem is related to CSS selector specificity and how it interacts with the `:has()` selector, potentially leading to unexpected styling results.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code. The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution by adjusting the selector specificity or using more precise targeting techniques.

## Problem Description:
The code uses the `:has()` selector to target parent elements containing a specific child element with a class. However, due to the specificity of other selectors, the intended styling might not always be applied correctly. This is a nuanced behavior of CSS specificity and can be confusing for developers who are not fully aware of how it functions.

## Solution:
The solution involves strategically adjusting the specificity of the `:has()` selector or employing more precise targeting methods, such as using a more specific class or ID on the parent container to ensure that the desired styles are applied correctly. For instance, we could use a more specific id or a parent class along with the :has() to adjust its precedence.
